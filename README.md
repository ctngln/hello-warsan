Say hello to a powerful poet, **Warsan Shire**.

This piece, from one of her most popular poems, gets shared a *lot* on the social medias:





> later that night

> i held an atlas in my lap

> ran my fingers across the whole world

> and whispered

> where does it hurt?




> it answered

> _everywhere_

> _everywhere_

> _everywhere_.





*~from* **_What They Did Yesterday Afternoon_**
