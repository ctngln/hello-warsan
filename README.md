Say hello to a powerful poet, **[Warsan Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsan_Shire)**.

This piece, from one of her most popular poems, gets shared a *lot* on the social medias:





> later that night

> i held an atlas in my lap

> ran my fingers across the whole world

> and whispered

> where does it hurt?




> it answered

> _everywhere_

> _everywhere_

> _everywhere_.
